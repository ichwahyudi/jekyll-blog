Just want to share about my problem a few months ago relate to memory compatibility. I used Asus Vivobook Ultra as my daily driver laptop and had a plan to get X1 Carbon, but my budget only match this option ðŸ˜‚. My laptop spec is Corei5 Intel 8th Generation, 4GB onboard memory, and I bought an 8GB additional memory (available one slot for memory upgrade).

I put the 8GB memory on the available slot and 12GB total memory was detected. But something weird happens, the browser crash and needs to reload for few times.

For additional information, the vscode app also crashes sometimes, which seems because vscode had some browser plugins. And I feel that disturbing my routine after a few days. Try to check again the speed of my laptop memory and yeah that is right using 2,400 MHz. I check the specifications at the online shop where bought the memory. All things seem right but still not satisfied. Check the official website of memory (in this case I bought Corsair Sodimm Memory). And then I found something that maybe relates to my case about memory compatibility. They said, "Compatibility: 6th and 7th Generation Intel Core i5 and i7 notebooks" but wait, where 8th Generation Intel? Yeah, they didn't say it.

And then I replace 8GB memory with 4GB memory. in this case, I use Samsung memory and already make sure of the compatibility. And yeah, the weird problem not happen again after weeks. ðŸ˜‚

So, if you facing the same problem out there, memory compatibility is important information, and don't skip it. Have a nice day!
