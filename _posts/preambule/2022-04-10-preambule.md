> _"Sometimes the moment after sunset is very wonderful."_

Not all people are aware of this moment. Most people focused on the sunset moment when the sun sinks and then goes. But, sometimes, when you are still looking into the sky after the sun sink, you will get a wonderful view! Yeah, this island is the best place to see the sunset so far from my perspective.

I lived in Bali for a few years. Bali has a lot of wonderful places, mixed between religion, culture and many wonderful places. I am so grateful had a chance to work on this island. My dream is to explore many places as far its possible, so far I have enough money! ðŸ˜‚
